# Disease Spread Simulation: Technical Approach

## Network Generation

- **Synthetic Network Generation**: Using NetworkX to create scale-free networks via the Barab√°si-Albert model, which better represents real-world social networks than random graphs.
- **Network Parameters**:
  - Initial nodes: 100-500 (configurable)
  - Average degree: 4-8 (configurable)
  - Power-law exponent: 2.5 (typical for social networks)

## Technical Stack

- **Core Libraries**:
  - NetworkX: Network generation and analysis
  - Plotly: Interactive network visualization
  - NumPy: Efficient numerical computations
  - Streamlit: Web interface for simulation control
- **Visualization Tools**:
  - Plotly for dynamic network visualization
  - Custom animation framework for infection spread
  - Real-time statistics dashboard

## Disease Spread Simulation

- **Model**: Modified SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered) with:
  - Transmission probability: 0.3-0.7 (configurable)
  - Incubation period: 2-5 days
  - Recovery time: 7-14 days
  - Mortality rate: 1-5%
- **Interaction Logic**:
  - Daily interactions based on network connections
  - Weighted transmission based on node degree
  - Memory-efficient state tracking

## Implementation Strategy

- **Data Structures**:
  - Sparse adjacency matrix for network storage
  - Hash tables for state tracking
  - Circular buffers for history
- **Algorithms**:
  - Event-driven simulation
  - Parallel processing for large networks
  - Incremental graph updates
- **Optimization Techniques**:
  - Batch processing of interactions
  - Lazy evaluation of non-critical updates
  - Caching of frequently accessed data

## Performance Considerations

- **Efficiency Measures**:
  - O(1) state lookups using hash tables
  - O(log n) updates for priority queues
  - Parallel processing for large networks
  - Incremental visualization updates
- **Scalability**:
